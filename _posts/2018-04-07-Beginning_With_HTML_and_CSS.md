title: Beginning with HTML/CSS - My Journey to becoming a developer
---

Finding Where to start can always be overshwlming to any beginner. Though I have always loved computer sience, it takes me a while to get into things, to get to know where to start and how to see my own progress. So, if you are a novice but want to learn HTML/CSS , you are exactly where you should be. I started off my career as a Quality Assurance Engineer. And for the days I have worked, I have only thought of a QA perspective. But, now I not only want to test but also want the developer to exactly pin point what to fix. For this, I thought there was no better way than learning to develop, sometimes from scratch or sometimes by bootstrapping.  And I certainly had to choos e path and frontend development was what I took my initial path because seeing what I develop will always be helpful for me to keep tract of my progress and get sastisfied in what I was learning. 

So, The first step I travelled in going back to the HTML/CSS I had learned in high school. 
1. What is HTML/CSS? 
Just like anywhere it can be written, HTML is hypertext markup language, a language that is used to describe the structure of the web page. CSS is Cascading style Sheets. We used CSS to give some designs to the web page. We can basically use HTML for its purpose. But lets think it as this way, CSS is independent of HTML and can be used for any markup language. However, I have started using HTML and CSS coexistingly. 

Let's start with a simple tag , Tags in HTML are elements which give the whole code a direction and to begin, you always have to find 
2. Where is HTML/CSS written?
SO HTML is written in atext file and you can give the extension as .html and a CSS file can be given extention as .CSS. simple as that. 

3. How do you execute HTM/CSS? 
Now, clicking on the HTML file will make your web page load. Just like what I did in my first tutorial. 

4. Things to know 
 So, what are some keywords that would help you to recognize where to use what

5. Attributes 
I won't be going here in much details but I will just let you know what I learned. 

Day 1 - Going through the basics of HTML, the attributes, the tags and everything else. 
Day 2 - Going thorugh the basics of CSS. I had never done CSS in my life before but then iyt felt easy doing it this time
Day 3- The hardest part , The javascript basics , Even though I had gone through a few "shortcut" tips to JavaScript, I had never actually made something I was proud to show with Java Script. But with HTML it was compeltely a differnet story. And when I learned it's not as easy as HTML but still doable, then I thought I should give it a try. But it's a complete different story. I will get to it in another post.

 Beginning with CSS tags 
Beginning with the simplest form of JavaScript
For a novice programmer for me, I am well aware of the technical jargons but still have a hard time mastering the language, And I know when I say master, for me it means being able to write a code
